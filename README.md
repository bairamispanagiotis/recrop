# ReCrop project

Recrop is a tool for every grower and researcher, as well as an opportunity to establish a global community of growers, that can provide updates for the protection of their crops.

Basically, the app provides information and updates about detected pests and diseases, giving also the solution to each problem.

## How it works
Users can: <br>
•	Connect to the application from any device and instantly see the active infections of their area.<br>
•	Post and update an infection based on how it evolves the growing season (grow-harvest).<br>
•	Make comments and rate about other infections and collaborate with other growers.<br>
•	Search infections locally or around the world.<br>
•	View on map the infections of their area or worldwide, among with statistics per country.<br>
•	View data in charts by combining different variables (i.e time and infections) that can be downloadable in pdf form.<br>
•	Search in library for pest/ diseases' information and also add their own.<br>

#Next steps
•	Update database with more information, which will be useful for growers.<br>
•	Develop mobile app for ios and android, which gives the capability to inform the app immediately through images taken by camera.<br>
•	Improve data analysis, so as to provide more open data to users and visitors.<br>
•	Creation of API, so other applications can make use of those data.
